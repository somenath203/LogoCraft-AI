## 🌟 Introduction  

LogoCraft AI is a web application that enables users to create **personalized logos** for their websites, apps, or businesses with the help of AI. The app provides a **step-by-step process** where users can specify details like the title, description, color palette, and design type for their logos.  

💡 Based on these inputs, the **Google Gemini API** generates logo ideas, and users can select their preferred design. Once finalized, the app generates a **high-quality logo** using advanced AI models. Users can **download their logos** and manage them through a user-friendly dashboard.  

🎯 Each user starts with **10 free credits**, and every logo generation consumes **5 credits**. Additional credits can be purchased if needed.

## ⏳ Note  

Generating a logo is a **complex process** that can take up to **2–3 minutes**, depending on the length and complexity of your prompt.  

⚠️ Occasionally, logo generation may fail due to **limitations in the usage provided by Hugging Face**, as the model is accessed via their Inference API.  

🙏 Your patience is **appreciated** during the logo creation process. If a failure occurs, please **try again later**.

## 🚧 Regarding Deployment  

⚠️ Currently, the application is not deployed to **Vercel** due to the time constraints associated with generating logos.  

⏱️ The AI-driven logo creation process can take approximately **2–3 minutes** to complete. However, on Vercel's Hobby plan, **serverless API routes** have a maximum execution duration of **5 seconds** (configurable up to 60 seconds). If a function exceeds this limit, it results in a **504 GATEWAY TIMEOUT** error.  

❌ This limitation is the **reason why the web app has not been deployed to Vercel**.
